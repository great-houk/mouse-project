# PMW3389 Driver

Like the SR1020 Driver, this provides a more generic implimentation of various methods used to communicate with and use the PMW3389 Mouse Sensor. There are many details in here which are limited because of the NDA which I signed to access them, so in order to understand why some things are the way they are, contact Pixart throught their support page to gain access to the datasheet and firmware.
